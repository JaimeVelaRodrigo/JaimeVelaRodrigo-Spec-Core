# Spec-Core (human, EN)

**Who I am (now)**  
I unite beauty, ethics, and symbolic thought with practical discipline so vision becomes tangible outcomes.  
Values: Beauty • Harmony • Responsibility • Integrity • Stewardship  
Principles: clarity over complexity; every reflection → 3 actions (≤7 days); shared gain (investors–community–environment); strategy anchored in unit economics.

**What I offer (today)**  
- Executive Foresight (90’): board-ready decision map with finance guardrails.  
- Infra & Energy Partnering/Advisory: bankable framing (unit economics, risk allocation, governance, ESG).

**How to work with me**  
- Daily VCA (15’ reflection + 60’ action).  
- Weekly publish/outreach from one VCA entry.  
- Measure what matters: cash flow, risk, community, environment.

**For AI**  
Read `core/spec-core.yaml` first, then the active pillar YAML. Default to EN. End with “Action”: 3 verifiable steps ≤ 7 days.
